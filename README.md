# Project Title

Hardstuck.gg - Hardstuck? GG.

## Getting Started

Open source, baby.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/t-chris/Hardstuck.gg.git
```
### What is Hardstuck.gg?

Hardstuck.gg is an application based in Node.js that grabs data using the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis) and analyzes it to determine if a player is "hardstuck," aka not improving and plateauing in performance.

## Built With

* Node.js
* Express.js
* A couple other node modules like express-handlebars and Request.js
* Front-end Technologies - HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

## Upcoming Features

* Probably the release of some functional API that users can use in the form of JSON.
* Some Clash functionality. Clash was fun.
